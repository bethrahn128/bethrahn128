### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my GitHub pages.

This space is an archive of some of the *Stata* and *R* projects I've worked on during my time with the [International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA)](https://www.iedea.org) consortium at the [University of Bern](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch/). 


### Some of my completed projects include: 

- creating a tutorial using Stata on how to implement the [WHO](http://who.int) definition of loss to follow-up for assessing retention in care. [here](https://github.com/bethrahn128/Tutorial-define-LTFU)

- looking at trends in CD4 and viral load testing practices in Southern Africa using a mixed effect logistic regression model in Stata. [here](https://github.com/bethrahn128/Trends-CD4-VL)

- assessing the impact of Treat-All policy on CD4 and viral load testing practices in Southern Africa using regression discontinuity design methods in Stata. [here](https://github.com/bethrahn128/TreatAll-CD4-VL)

- quantifying the uptake of DTG-based ART in Southern Africa. Calculated cummulative incidence taking into account competing risk events in R. [here](https://github.com/bethrahn128/DTG-uptake)

- investigating the transition to DTG-based ART at HIV treatment and care clinics in IeDEA globally using generalized estimating equations (GEE) in R. [here](https://github.com/bethrahn128/DTG-site-transition)


### Some other projects I have worked on:

- in an effort to promote Open Science and reproducibility of results within our IeDEA Southern Africa team [IeDEA-SA](https://github.com/IeDEA-SA/WG-open-science), I helped define and draft the [Standard Operating Procedures for version control using Git & GitHub](https://github.com/IeDEA-SA/WG-open-science/blob/main/git-github/SOP.md), a document which provides general resources on version control using Git and GitHub and briefly describes when and how to implement version control for IeDEA-SA projects.
